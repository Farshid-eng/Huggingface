Hugging Face Transformers – Practical Examples

📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates practical usage of Hugging Face Transformers for modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
The focus is on understanding how pretrained transformer models are loaded, fine-tuned, and used in real-world workflows using the Hugging Face ecosystem.

The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and step-by-step experimentation.

🧠 Key Concepts Covered

Using pretrained transformer models via transformers

Tokenization with Hugging Face tokenizers

Model inference using pipelines

Fine-tuning transformer models for downstream NLP tasks

Handling datasets and training configurations

Practical NLP workflows with minimal boilerplate

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on model backend)

Datasets (Hugging Face)

NumPy

🎯 Why Hugging Face?

Hugging Face has become the de facto standard for transformer-based NLP due to:

Large collection of pretrained models

Unified APIs for training and inference

Strong community and research adoption

Easy transition from research to production

This repository serves as a hands-on introduction to that ecosystem.
How to Run

Install dependencies:
pip install transformers datasets

Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook Huggingface.ipynb

📌 Notes

The notebook emphasizes conceptual understanding over task-specific optimization

Examples are easily extensible to custom datasets and models

Suitable for ML engineers transitioning into NLP or LLM-based systems
